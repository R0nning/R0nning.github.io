_Dwir, small rural hamlet nestled within the hills at the end of the Long Road -a final resting place for adventurers and travelers. The people of Dwir eek out an existance knowing full well they may be consumed by the weather, or the denizens of the world around them._
 
Dwir was one of the first urban maps completed where I developed my style. The buildings -since there are fewer- are actually brought into photoshop, textured, shadowed, and highlighted seperately before being placed on the base map. This lead to a much higher quality at the expense of time.
