_Kalsgrad the ancient city of the dwarves -built within the shadow of fortress Agunshaar and perched up high. It is home to both demi-humans and humans, making a living off the dangerous but fertile land of the Naar River. The people are insular, but festive when comfortable, focused on bettering their lives and the lives of their neighbors._
 
Kalsgrad was the most recent urban map completed. I tried several new colors and expanded the palette a little in order to get a new asthetic while also keeping the details of smaller urban maps. It needs some polish- something I have been meaning to return too, as well as map flourishes, typography and other mapping elements.
