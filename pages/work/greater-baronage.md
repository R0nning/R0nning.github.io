_The Greater Baronage is filled with a plethora of kingdoms, warlords, and peoples whom farm the land, fell its forests, and dig its mountains. Four distinct peoples occupy this land, along with countless subcultures and ethnic groups that continue to blur the lines into one cohesive group._
 
This map was my first regional map in which I developed a style. The mountains, were done via photoshop and wacom tablet, brushing them in and outlining. I am still not as satisfied with the color choice and have been meaning to go back and work on blending them with the terrain. Next, the forests are made with indvidual placed trees within Illustrator. It was time intensive and I have been meaning to expirement with other styles to see if I like them better. Overal, I am very happy with it. Despite the time it took to complete, there is a certain appeal to the piece that draws the eye.
* **Baronage Politico** . Labeled and marked, the political map has all important landmarks and cities named and highlighted.
* **Baronage Naked** . This map is clear of various flourishes to emphasis the natural features of the piece.
* **Baronage Provincial** . The provincial map depicts the kingdoms and regions found throughout the Baronage. Each province -or domain- is unique in their own right.
