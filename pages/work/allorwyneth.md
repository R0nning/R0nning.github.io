_Allorwyneth is home to a dedicated people descended from barbarians and reaving berserkers. They are born seamen, with mastery over the waves via their elongated ships, as well as apt fishermen and fierce warriors. The city itself is a mix of wood, thatch, and timber framed homes nestled amongst expertly crafted drainage basins to help keep the city dry during the constant rain. It is nestled between forested hills and protected by stone walls and the castle of Cearnallor_
 
Allorwyneth was my first ‘large city’ project where I needed to meticulously create and place every single building. All of this begins with various sketches and designs of the city until I am satisfied with how it looks. Then the planning and constructing begins in Adobe Illustrator and is brought over to Photoshop for shading and texturing. Allorwyneth is still not 100% completed -I want to add typography, mapping flourishes, and other pieces of information to make it presentable- but for now, I am pretty dang happy with how it turned out.
