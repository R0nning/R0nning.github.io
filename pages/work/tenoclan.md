_Tenoclan, the caravan stop along the Gold Road where one can refill their water skins and find rest and relaxation. The arena is available for entertainment as well as a plethora of inns and bars to help escape the heat, and a personâ€™s responsibilities. On the outside of town, fields of indigo grow for trade._
 
Tenoclan is my first urban map. At the time, the aesthetic represented something more of a SW desert type of feel. There are saguaros, and adobe looking buildings all done in Illustrator and textured in Photoshop. This is a piece I will return to in order to bring up to my current standards and will most likely do a larger urban setting in this aesthetic in the near future.
