## Professional Experience
-----

### Globus Medical
**Graphic Designer for Graphic Cases**
*April, 2015 - August 2017*
Philadelphia, PA
A position created based off of my technical skillset- the _Graphic Cases_ division of Globus Medical required an illustrator help accentuate their instrument and implants within their aluminum and steel cases. My ability to illustrate their product was paramount in their decision to create the position.
Primary responsibilities included:
- Creation of physical artwork for each _Graphic Cases_ using the positioning of spinal instruments and implants set in place according to our engineers. Focused on shading, linework, and coloring of those instruments and ensuring the proper typography and verbiage standards were used when notating both instruments and implants. Responsible for the title of the case, the logo placement, and ensuring standards were upheld throughout the design.
- Ensuring entire library of _Graphic Cases_ (over 500 separate cases) met current rev levels while working and planning with vendors to ensure they had the proper artwork on file. Managed the entire library of silkscreen and gradient images to guarantee the proper artwork was applied to the right order. Meticulously updated the entire library to ensure it met a new standard of gradient tray.
- Introduced color standards between multiple vendors to ensure their colors matched. The application of colors on our aluminum modules and steel plates needed to be standardized which was promoted and planned by me. These colors needed to match that of our anodized titanium implants in order to aid our surgeons when identifying the proper implants.
- Aided the new Robotics and Trauma divisions with the look and aesthetics of their case, helping them pick their color scheme and make design decisions based off our Spinal division and work. Was then required to work with out vendors to ensure the prototypes and subsequent cases met their new aesthetics. 
- Worked primarily in Adobe Illustrator and TruMark software while also using in AutoCAD for various instruments, implants, and drawings. While building the artwork, I often referenced CREO software as well as eDrawings, STP viewers and OBJ viewers and others, all to ensure the implants and instruments were clear and correct.

### Summerwood Limited
**Contract Technician**
*August 2013 - February, 2015*

While not directly related to design, working as a contract technician for Summerwood allowed me better understand hardware and devices that are directly related to my field. My contract involved traveling to various stores and locations, installing hardware, and setting the store up with the latest technology.
Primary responsibilities included:
- Installing, upgrading and maintaining cameras, sound equipment, networking devices, and hardware. For fresh installs, responsibilities include running cables, servicing point-of-sale terminals, installing modems, screens, security cameras and routers. Would have to call multiple services and follow checklists to ensure the store functioned properly during work hours.
- Tasked with helping technicians with calls and problems during peak hours. Required to drive to various locations around PA, NJ, and DE in order to maintain their network of equipment.
 
### Tiny Prints  |  Shutterfly
**Production Designer**
*October, 2010 - May, 2011*
Tempe, AZ
A seasonal employment with the incentive of being brought on full time upon conclusion of the holidays. Was able to secure additional employment via exceptional customer service and technical skillset.
Responsibilities include:
- Quality assuring photos by running scripts to balance levels and curves of photos, as well as auto color correcting to make sure each picture was at the best quality for print. Furthermore, was responsible for evaluating each photo for graininess, brightness & darkness, and adjusting its crop to ensure the customer had the perfect photo for their order. Would often use Photoshop to touch up photos at customer’s request -something that was highly regarded by my superiors.
- Quality assuring text by spell checking, grammar checking, and punctuation checking in order to ensure the dialogue matched company standards. This included verbiage on invitations, holiday cards, business cards, and wedding invitations. 
- Communicating with customers when any of the above were deemed to be incorrect or unacceptable ultimately aiding them in finding a solution. This included encouraging separate photos be used, encouraging alternate punctuation and text, and sometimes helping with separate products altogether.
