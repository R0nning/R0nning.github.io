Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

### Update 5-17

Halfway through this project and I think I have the framework completed. Links, colors- everything works and goes how I see fit. I made a checklist of further things I want to improve but I believe now I will be working on the core of getting all of my art presented on this portfolio. Now comes the biggest part of this portfolio- filling everything out. 

This is fun.
